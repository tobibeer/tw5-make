The plugin $:/plugins/tobibeer/make provides:

; ''make[]''
: a filter that allows to create unique or random tiddler titles

If no input titles are passed to it, e.g. via  `[[]make[]]` it will create unique, even random output titles, otherwise operate on given input titles. There are many ways for you to specify exactly how you want your titles to be created using the [[operand|make-Operand]].

!! Unique

The titles created by the ''make[]'' filter will always be unique in these ways:

# no two titles in the output of make will be the same
## no existing tiddler will have a title generated by make OR
## no field at a given tiddler will have the string generated by make OR
## no index at a given data-tiddler will have the string generated by make

!! Refreshing

Be aware that, as of TiddlyWiki <<version>>, using this filter with the <<x ListWidget>> or <<x SetWidget>> will ''recompute'' the titles at each refresh, i.e. at every single event, even just clicking a link. To prevent this refresh behaviour, use the [[setvars]] widget.

While this can be very useful for creating unique titles, i.e. when using the <<x ActionSetFieldWidget>>, it is not so much, if you plan on rendering a list and don't expect it to update with every move you make.
